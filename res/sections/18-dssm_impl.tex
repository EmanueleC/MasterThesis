\chapter{An implementation of DSMM}

\subsubsection{Net input inspection}

N-gram ``hashing'' started from the embeddings generated in \ref{ssec:wemb} and
produced 2 term matrices for corpus and queries (the following three modalities
were considered: unstemmed without stopwords removal; unstemmed with stopwords
removal; stemmed + stopwords removal)

157394 (unique words in corpus) + 1459 (unique words in queries) = 158853
reduced to 18846 n-grams.

Only the documents in pre-ranked results (see \ref{sssec:galretr} subsection)
were considered.

Shape of term matrices (both corpus and queries): (2079, 18846)

Each term matrix has different vectors that contain the frequencies of their
n-gram in the document/query. They are hot vectors of n-gram (very sparse):

Corpus term matrix - non zero frequency: 14.039\%

Queries term matrix - non zero frequency: 0.241\%

As example, the distributions of the first 1000 ngrams frequencies of the first
100 documents/queries were plotted:

\textbf{Unsemmed; without stopwords removal ngrams inspection}:\\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: \#in, \#of, \#an

Most frequent ngrams for queries: \#re, \#pr, \#cz \\

Most frequent ngrams (all term matrixes considered): \\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: \#th, the, he\#

Most frequent ngrams for queries: \#th, the, he\# \\

\textbf{Unstemmed; with stopwords removal ngrams inspection}:\\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: \#co, \#re, \#pr

Most frequent ngrams for queries: \#re, \#pr, \#cz \\

Most frequent ngrams (all term matrixes considered): \\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: ed\#, ion, ing

Most frequent ngrams for queries: ed\#, ion, ing \\

\textbf{Stemmed; with stopwords removal ngrams inspection}:\\

Most frequent ngrams in the slice (only first 1000 ngrams were considered, so
they all start with \#):\\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: \#co, \#re, \#pr

Most frequent ngrams for queries: \#re, \#pr, \#cz \\

Most frequent ngrams (all term matrixes considered): \\

Most frequent ngrams for corpus: on\#, ion, \#co

Most frequent ngrams for queries: on\#, ion, \#co \\
